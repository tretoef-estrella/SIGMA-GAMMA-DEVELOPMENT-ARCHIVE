## The Gamma Protocol (Γ)

**Status:** Experimental — Mathematically verified, operationally pending validation

**Formula:**
```
Γ = S + Ξ · e^(-H·(1-Φ))
```

**Reviewed by:**
- ✅ Gemini (xAI) — Proposed and stress-tested
- ✅ Grok (xAI) — Mathematical verification
- ✅ ChatGPT (OpenAI) — Structural analysis
- ✅ Claude (Anthropic) — Integration assessment

**Consensus:** Formula is mathematically sound at boundaries. Φ (External Support) requires empirical definition before production use.
